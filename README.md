# machine-learning-course

Exercises for the machine learning & deep learning masters course at HTWG Konstanz.

The exercises are separated into directories. Some exercises are notebooks, some are python projects.

- Notebooks (`.ipynb`) can be opened via the "Open in Colab" link at the top of the file.
- Python projects with a `Pipfile` need external dependencies. Install [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) and run `pipenv install` in the exercise folder to install those dependencies. Afterwards, you can run the python script with your local python version (3.6+).
